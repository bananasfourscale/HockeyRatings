Goalies:
    Goalie_Utilization: TOImin / GPteam
        -Rational: The more a goalie is used, the more responsibility they have,
            the more likely their stats will be dragged toward norm. This is
            designed to hopefully be a counter to sample size to reward high
            working goalies.
        -TOImin: Time on ice converted to minutes
        -GPteam: the number of total games the goalies current team has played
        
Teams:
    Clutch (under review): (W%lead1 * 5) + (W%lead2 * 10)
        -Rational: Ideally this would be a simple way to show teams holding
            leads vs makikng comebacks but the free API doesn't quite have the
            level of insight that the manual version did. Thinking of removing.
        - W%lead1: Win percentage when team is leading after 1st period
        - W%lead2: Win percentage when team is leading after 2nd period
    Recent_Form: (W * 1) + (L * 0) + (OT * 0.33)
        -Rational: somewhat self explanitory, will track just the last 10 games
            of a team to get thier more recent form as opposed to other stats
            which are based on season results and can be slow to shift.
            Essentially works as an accelerator for change that is scalable by
            chaning the weight of the metric
        - W: wins in last 10 games
        - L: losses in last 10 games
        - OT: overtime losses in last 10 games
    Scoring_Rating: ((GFG - GAG) * 0.75) + ((SHFG - SHAG) * 0.25)
        -Rational: takes shooting difference and scoring difference to try to
            account for the fact that very high scoring teams tend to show up
            higher on many metrics, but don't nessirarily mean the team wins
            alot or is good. Defence wins championships. So having a high
            difference between offence and defense is better than just scoring
            alot.
        - GFG: Goals for per game (mean over all games not per 60min)
        - GAG: Goals against per game (mean over all games not per 60min)
        - SHFG: Shots for per game (mean over all games not per 60min)
        - SHAG: Shots against per game (mean over all games not per 60min)
    Special_Teams: PP% + PK%
        - Rational: Simply combines both special team metrics. This is generally
            a very
