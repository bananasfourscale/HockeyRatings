Goalies:
    Goalie_Utilization: TOImin / GPteam
        -Rational: The more a goalie is used, the more responsibility they have,
            the more likely their stats will be dragged toward norm. This is
            designed to hopefully be a counter to sample size to reward high
            working goalies.
        -TOImin: Time on ice converted to minutes
        -GPteam: the number of total games the goalies current team has played

Teams:
    Strength of Schedule:
        1. SoS: Wsc + Lrk;
        -Rational: It's not just eough to win, but rather to win against the
            other best teams in the league. Wining against good teams gives
            more points while losing doesn't change the score at all. Standard
            ELO rankings don't punish losses other than no more gain of points.
            Over time the punishment for losing games is that the points are
            scaled by games played, so points become worth less individually.
        - Wsc: The winning teams current score
        - Lrk: the losing teams' current average ranking

    Clutch (under review): 

    Lead_Retention:
        1. Lead Retention: (TL)

    Win Rating:
        1. Win Rating: (W * 1) + (L * 0) + (OT * 1/3)
        -Rational: Same basic calculation as recent form (below) but taking in
            to account the entire season when looking at record. In the end no
            matter the style of game that a team plays if they consistantly win
            most of their games, they can't really be that bad.
        - W: wins in this season
        - L: losses in this season
        - OT: overtime losses this season

    Recent_Form:
        1. Recent_Form: (W * 1) + (L * 0) + (OT * 1/3)
        -Rational: somewhat self explanitory, will track just the last 10 games
            of a team to get their more recent form as opposed to other stats
            which are based on season results and can be slow to shift.
            Essentially works as an accelerator for change that is scalable by
            chaning the weight of the metric
        - W: wins in last 10 games
        - L: losses in last 10 games
        - OT: overtime losses in last 10 games
        2. Streak: (W * 1) | (L * -1) | (OT * -1/3)
        -Rational: an even greater accelerator than the general recent form,
            this stat rewards the team that is currenly on the longest winning
            streak greatly and vice-versa.
        - W: wins in current streak
        - L: losses in current streak
        - OT: overtime losses in current streak
